        Powered by BackBlaze, ib2d2 for Android is built on B2 Cloud Storage. B2 Cloud Storage is an
        affordable cloud storage solution that challenges the pricing and reliability of Amazon S3,
        Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. B2D2 was originally developed in Python as a tool to
        assist system administrators with backup management. ib2d2 for iOS was a wrapper of B2 which
        allowed BackBlaze customers to interface with B2 Cloud via their phone. ib2d2 for Android
        does not require a BackBlaze account, adds team sharing features, increases security, and
        works to make ib2d2 more user friendly.
