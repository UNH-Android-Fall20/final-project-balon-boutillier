## Basic Overview
Dropped your phone? Someone stole it? Where do you keep your precious memories and photos? iB2D2 is an all in one backup solution to back up your media in a 3-2-1 format (two remote copies, one local) to ensure that you never lose your important files. iB2D2 leverages BackBlaze and FireBase to store data and provide you a list of backups, a file viewer, and much more!

What's better than two copies of data? __Three__.

## Key Features

* Browse your backups right from your device
* Hash comparisons to ensure backup integrity
* Modify your profile, upload custom avatars, select your display name
* Seperate networking thread to prevent app freezing during backups
* Lossless compression of media
* Files encrypted in transit (https)

## How It Works
Simply install the app, create an account, and click the plus to start backing up your files!
